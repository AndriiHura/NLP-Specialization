# NLP Specialization

NLP Specialization made by deeplearning.ai (Natural Language Processing Specialization)

This 4-course specialization is launched on June 17. Right now the repository contains files for Course 1, 2, and 3. The assignment files are already completed.

Further files of Course 4 will be uploaded when the courses go live.

## Edits
Update 1: Course 3 materials added on (07/31/2020). More Week materials will be added by Aug 2.

Update 2: Course 3 final materials added on (08/02/2020). High size files can be downloaded by Coursera.

Update 3: C3_Wx_Assignment_original.ipynb files with no prefilled code are added in Course 3 by demand from Sun Trancks.

Update 4: For the launch of Course 4, I have decided only to upload the Assignment ipynb and the prefilled version of it. The additional resources (data/model/utils.py) can be acquired from Coursera.

## Usage

Use the assignment files with prefilled code for reference only.
